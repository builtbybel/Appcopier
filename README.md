# Appcopier
### Back up key things on your Windows PC, perform a reset or simply go back in time.

This small project is still in the making. It allows you to back up and restore your most important Windows 11 preferences and settings offline and locally. The app [mimics the new backup app of Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-your-windows-pc-87a81f8a-78fa-456e-b521-ac0560e32338) -  which is part of the Windows 11 2023 Update (23H2) - but without the obligation of the cloud. I will certainly expand and enhance it over time. 

How it works? Quite simple! Only registry entries and/or associated folders and files of the respective area are exported. This process is very quick and lightweight, akin to the weight of a fly. So don't be surprised if the first backups fly through in the nanosecond range. For the future, I could envision an addition of a more dynamic option in the form of scripts/plugins, where even more complex things could be backed up.

The project might remind some of you of one of my first public projects - CloneApp. It's been a long time. I wrote CloneApp back in the day with Classic Visual Basic 6 and Delphi, and eventually, I abandoned its maintenance. 

I've written and tested **Appcopier on Windows 11**, but it should also run on Windows 10 (no guarantee from me, though). Give it a try! This is the first release, and there's more to come.
